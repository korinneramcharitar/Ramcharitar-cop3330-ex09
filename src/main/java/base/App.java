//Sometimes you have to round up to the next number rather than follow standard rounding rules.
//Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room. Prompt for the length and width, and assume one gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the number of gallons needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.
//You will need to purchase 2 gallons of paint to cover 360 square feet.

//Remember, you canâ€™t buy a partial gallon of paint. You must
//round up to the next whole gallon.

//Use a constant to hold the conversion rate.
//Ensure that you round up to the next whole number.
